## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r formula}
##Fd Growth intercept = cm/year 
SI = 4.11
H = 20
A = 5
b1 = 1 + exp(5.57 - 1.15 log50 - 0.238log(S-1.3))
b2 = 1 + exp(5.57 - 1.15 logA - 0.238log(S-1.3))
H = 1.3 +(S-1.3)*(b1/b2)

S = 0.39 + (0.31*H) + ((33.38 * H)/A)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
